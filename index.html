    Our students aren't called students, but rather Ultimates! We refer our
    students as such because of their talents! An Ultimate is a prodigy in any
    given field or career known to man! Some of our Ultimates include the
    Ultimate Swordswoman, Ultimate Artist, Ultimate Programmer, Ultimate Baseball Star!
    Anyone who graduates from our facility is set for
    life!

    The only faculty present at our school is me, Monokuma! I allow Ultimates
    to do whatever they please to strengthen their talents, as well as their
    thinking and learning skills, as long as they follow my rules and refrain
    from disobeying me!

    <h1 id="box5">Apply!</h1>
    <img src="anotherjinthing.png" alt="Jin Kirigiri">
    To Apply to Hope's Peak Academy...you don't! Our Ultimates are scouted by our
    school's team to determine if they really are the best of the best! Not any
    average joe gets to step foot here, there's a process! Prior to scouting,
    the student must be at least 16-years-old and already enrolled in another
    high school to be considered. However, this only applies to the Main Course.
    Reserve Course is for students who aren't talented, but they must take
    an entrance exam to attend. The tuition for these students is 200K a year,
    with room and board, textbooks, activities, and facilities considered.
    Scholarships are offered at our school, but they aren't as easily attained,
    and no outside scholarships are accepted.
